            <p>
                I have recently graduated with distinction from <em>Queensland University of Technology</em> with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and now currently working as an Information Technology Analyst at <em>Griffith University</em>.
                <br/><br/>
                What I value most is working within diverse teams, as collaborating with different perspectives leads to creating great products. 
                <br/><br/>
                With my wealth of experience supporting clients, my continuous learning attitude, and my creative problem-solving skills, I believe I can bring value to any team.
